    <h2 id="text-1">In my life, I have given a fuck about many people and many things. 
        I have also not given a fuck about many people and many things.</h2>
    <h3 class="marker-1">And those fucks I have not given have made all the difference.</h3>
    <h2 id="text-2">People often say the key to confidence and success in life is to simply “not give a fuck.” Indeed, we often refer to the strongest, most admirable people we know in terms of their lack of fucks given. Like “Oh, look at Susie working weekends again, she doesn’t give a fuck.” Or “Did you hear that Tom called the company president an asshole and still got a raise anyway? Holy shit, that dude does not give a fuck.” Or “Jason got up and ended his date with Cindy after 20 minutes. He said he wasn’t going to listen to her bullshit anymore. Man, that guy does not give a fuck</h2>

    <h2 id="text-3">Chances are you know somebody in your life who, at one time or another, 
        did not give a fuck and went on to accomplish amazing feats. Perhaps there was a time in your 
        life where you simply did not give a fuck and excelled to some extraordinary heights. I know for myself, quitting my day job in finance after only six weeks and telling my boss that I was going to start selling dating advice online ranks pretty high up there in my own “didn’t give a fuck” hall of fame.
     Same with deciding to sell most of my possessions and move to South America. </h2>
    <h3 class="marker-2">Fucks given? <br> None. <br>Just went and did it.</h3>
    <h2 id="text-4">Now, while not giving a fuck may seem simple on the surface, it’s a whole new bag of burritos under the hood. I don’t even know what that sentence means, but I don’t give a fuck. A bag of burritos sounds awesome, so let’s just go with it.
        The point is, most of us struggle throughout our lives by giving too many fucks in situations where fucks do not deserve to be given. We give a fuck about the rude gas station attendant who gave us too many nickels. We give a fuck when a show we liked was canceled on TV. We give a fuck when our coworkers don’t bother asking us about our awesome weekend. We give a fuck when it’s raining and we were supposed to go jogging in the morning.
        Fucks given everywhere. Strewn about like seeds in mother-fucking spring time. And for what purpose? For what reason? Convenience? Easy comforts? A pat on the fucking back maybe?</h2>
    <h3 class="marker-3">This is the problem, <br>my friend.</h3>

<div class="text-box-3">
    <h2 id="text-5">This is no way to live, man. So stop fucking around. Get your fucks together. And here, allow me to fucking show you. </h2>
